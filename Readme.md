# Simple Tickers

Blades in the Dark style progress clocks that show on the sidebar for Foundry VTT. Thank you to the original module [Global Progress Clocks](https://github.com/CarlosFdez/global-progress-clocks) Unlike the parent module, Simple Tickers allows players to have their own, personal tickers that they have full control of (creating, editing, and deleting).
For ticker creation dialog appears as follows:

* Name - The name that will be displayed with the clock
* Size - The number of segments
* Privacy - Allows the user to customize clock privacy. Public allows everyone to see the clock. Private hides the clock from all but GMs and clock owner. Hide Name replaces the clock name with "???" on everyone's screen except the ticker owner's and GM's.

In the screenshots below, you can see the privacy options in action. The left image is the GM's screen. The center image is Player2's screenshot. The right image is Player3's screen.

GM tickers can only be modified by a GM. Player tickers can only be modified by that player and GMs.
